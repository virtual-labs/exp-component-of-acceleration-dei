      "explanations": {
        "a": "Radial velocity is related to slider motion, not flow rate.",
        "b": "Flow rate (Q) is used directly to calculate water flow velocity.",
        "c": "Angular velocity is measured from rotation, not flow rate.",
        "d": "Tangential velocity is related to angular motion, not Q."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Coriolis acceleration cannot be maximum when relative velocity is zero.",
        "b": "Coriolis acceleration is proportional to relative velocity, so it becomes zero.",
